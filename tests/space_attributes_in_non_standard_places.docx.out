This document has manually modified XML structure to test handling of xml:space attributes placed in different places.
xml:space=”preserve” are added to text elements usually. We know that some OOXML exporters add it to w:document and there can be more unexpected situations in the future as well.

This document has xml:space=”preserve” added to w:document element.

It should be derived by text (w:t) with single space at the end of this line so the text should be visible: 

The text (w:t) at the end of this line has xml:space=”default” attribute so space should not be visible:

This paragraph (w:p) has xml:space=”default” attribute but the text element (w:t) at the end of this line has xml:space=”preserve” so space at the end of this line should be visible:
